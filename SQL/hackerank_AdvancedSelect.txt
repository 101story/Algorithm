Type of Triangle

Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

- Equilateral: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
- Isosceles: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
- Scalene: It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.
- Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

select select if(A+B<=C or B+C<=A or C+A<=B, "Not A Triangle", 
    if(A=B and B=C , "Equilateral", 
    if(A=B or B=C or A=C, "Isosceles", "Scalene"))) from TRIANGLES;

SELECT 
	CASE WHEN A + B > C AND A + C > B AND B + C > A THEN 
	CASE WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral' 
		WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles' 
		ELSE 'Scalene' 
		END 
	ELSE 'Not A Triangle' 
	END FROM TRIANGLES;
