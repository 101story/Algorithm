문제) The Blunder

Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's 0 key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeroes removed), and the actual average salary.

Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.: actural-miscalculated average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.

제출 답 >>>

SELECT (SELECT ROUND(AVG(salary),0) FROM EMPLOYEES) 
    - (SELECT ROUND(AVG(MISST.A),0) FROM 
    (SELECT REPLACE(SALARY, '0', '') A FROM EMPLOYEES) MISST);

nice code >>>
SELECT CEIL(AVG(Salary)-AVG(REPLACE(Salary,'0',''))) FROM EMPLOYEES;

문제) Top Earners

We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly salary*months worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as 2 space-separated integers.

제출 답 >>>

SELECT MAX(MONTHS*SALARY), COUNT(*)
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE (SELECT MAX(MONTHS*SALARY) TOTAL FROM EMPLOYEE)=MONTHS*SALARY;

nice code >>>
select salary*months as earnings, count(*) from employee
group by earnings
order by earnings desc limit 1;

문제) Weather Observation Station 13

Query the sum of Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION having values greater than 38.7880 and less than 137.2345. Truncate your answer to  decimal places.

제출 답 >>>
SELECT TRUNCATE(SUM(LAT_N),4) FROM STATION
    WHERE LAT_N BETWEEN 38.7880 AND 137.2345;

문제) Weather Observation Station 15


Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than 137.2345. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.

제출 답 >>>
SELECT ROUND(LONG_W,4) FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N  < 137.2345 
ORDER BY LAT_N DESC 
LIMIT 1;

문제) Manhattan Distance
a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).

제출 답 >>>

select round(abs(max(LAT_N)-min(LAT_N))+abs(max(long_w)-min(long_w)),4) from station 

문제) Euclidean Distance 

제출 답 >>>
select round( (pow(max(LAT_N)-min(LAT_N))+pow(max(long_w)-min(long_w))) ,4) from station
